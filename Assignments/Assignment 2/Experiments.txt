Experimental Setup

Simulation Parameters

- Map Dimensions: The simulations were conducted on a square map with dimensions 700 units by 700 units.
- Unit Types: Each team consisted of an equal number of Marines and Tanks.
- Unit Counts Tested: 20, 50, 100, and 300 Marines and Tanks per team, resulting in total unit counts of 40, 100, 200, and 600 units per team.
- Bounce Mechanic: The bounce parameter was set to true, allowing units to bounce off walls upon collision.
- Attack Policies:
  - Red Team: Attack Weakest, Attack Closest, Attack Most Dangerous.
  - Blue Team: Attack Weakest, Attack Closest, Attack Most Dangerous.
- Total Combinations: All combinations of Red and Blue team policies were tested, resulting in 9 policy combinations.
- Number of Runs: Each unique combination was simulated 100 times with different random seeds to ensure statistical significance.
- Total Simulations: 3,600 simulations were conducted (4 unit counts × 9 policy combinations × 100 runs).

For each simulation run, I recorded:

- UnitCount: Number of Marines and Tanks per team.
- RedPolicyName: Attack policy used by the Red team.
- BluePolicyName: Attack policy used by the Blue team.
- Result: Outcome of the simulation (RedWin, BlueWin, or Draw).
- Count: Number of times a specific result occurred.
- TotalRuns: Total number of runs for the scenario (always 100).
- Percentage: Percentage of each result out of the total runs.

1. Attack Closest vs. Attack Closest:
   - Result: 100% Draws across all unit counts.
   - Interpretation: When both teams prioritize attacking the closest enemy units, engagements become symmetrical, leading to stalemates where neither side gains a decisive advantage.

2. Attack Most Dangerous Policy:
   - Lower Unit Counts (20, 50, 100):
     - Red Team: High win rates when facing Blue's Attack Closest.
     - Example: At unit count 50, Red wins about 98% of the time against Blue's Attack Closest.
   - Higher Unit Count (300):
     - Effectiveness Decreases: Red's Attack Most Dangerous leads to an appromiate of 60% wins against Blue's Attack Most Dangerous but only 20% against Blue's Attack Closest.
     - Interpretation: In large-scale battles, the chaotic environment reduces the effectiveness of targeting the most dangerous units, possibly due to overwhelmed unit numbers and reduced precision.

3. Attack Weakest Policy:
   - Lower to Mid Unit Counts (20, 50, 100):
     - Red Team: Strong performance against Blue's Attack Closest.
     - Example: At unit count 100, Red wins 100% against Blue's Attack Closest.
   - Higher Unit Count (300):
     - Mixed Results: Red's Attack Weakest shows improved performance with about 60% wins against Blue's Attack Weakest but lower effectiveness against Blue's Attack Closest.
     - Interpretation: Targeting the weakest units is effective in smaller battles but becomes less advantageous in larger battles where tactical positioning plays a more significant role.

4. Bounce Mechanic Influence:
   - High Bounce Activity: Enabled bouncing likely contributes to the high number of draws when both teams use Attack Closest, as units continuously rebound off walls without achieving decisive engagements.
   - Strategic Implications: Bouncing allows units to re-engage multiple times, prolonging battles and increasing the likelihood of mutual eliminations or stalemates.

5. Unit Count Impact:
   - Smaller Battles (20, 50): Strategic targeting (Most Dangerous, Weakest) significantly influences outcomes.
   - Larger Battles (100, 300): The sheer number of units dilutes the impact of specific targeting strategies, making positional tactics (like Attack Closest) more dominant or leading to chaotic engagements with mixed results.

Conclusion:

Based on the experimental results:

- Attack Most Dangerous emerges as the strongest policy in small to medium-sized battles (unit counts 20, 50, 100), particularly when facing opponents using Attack Closest. This strategy allows teams to neutralize high-threat units effectively, reducing the overall damage received.

- Attack Closest consistently results in draws when both teams employ it, indicating a lack of decisive advantage in symmetrical targeting strategies. However, when opposing an Attack Weakest policy, Attack Closest maintains a moderate advantage, especially at higher unit counts.

- Attack Weakest demonstrates variable effectiveness. It performs exceptionally well against Attack Closest in smaller engagements but loses its edge in larger battles against more aggressive targeting strategies.
