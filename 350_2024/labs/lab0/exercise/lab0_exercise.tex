1. [11 marks] In file \texttt{p1.c} implement the following functions:
\begin{cppcode*}{linenos=false}
// precond: n > 0
void simple_sort(int A[], int n) {
    // ...
}

// Test code
// check whether simple_sort works by setting up an array
// and printing its elements after sorting
void test() {
    // ...
}
\end{cppcode*}

\texttt{simple\_sort} rearranges elements in array \texttt{A} in non-decreasing order. 
In function \texttt{main()} test \texttt{simple\_sort} by calling it with an initialized array and
printing the sorted result. 
Simple-Sort works by iteratively determining the minimum element, 
swapping it with the first element, shortening the array by one element, 
and continuing the process until there is no work left to do. \\

We provide skeleton files, along with a \texttt{main} which calls your \texttt{test} function.
To compile the files, 
\[ \texttt{gcc -g -Wall -Wextra -Wconversion -Wsign-conversion -O p1.c p1\_main.c} \]

2. [14 marks]  Files \texttt{p2.h} and \texttt{p2.c} contains an empty linked-list structure implementation. 
The end of a list is marked by a node with \texttt{next = 0}.
In file \texttt{p2.c}, implement the functions using \texttt{malloc}/\texttt{free} 
(\textbf{NOT} \texttt{new}/\texttt{delete}!)
