1. [20 marks] Function templates

\bigskip 

In file \texttt{max.cpp}:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item Write function

    \[ \texttt{size\_t index\_of\_max(const int *A, size\_t n)} \]

    which is supposed to return the smallest index of a maximum element in
    array \texttt{A} that holds \texttt{n} elements. Only use \texttt{<} to compare elements

\item Write function template \texttt{index\_of\_max} that generalizes above function to work
    with any element type \texttt{T}. You can only assume that \texttt{T} supports operator \texttt{<} ,
    and nothing else (\textbf{in particular, the CC or AO doesn't have to be supported})

\item Specialize (or overload) the template function for arrays of element types \texttt{char *} and
    \texttt{const char *} so that the smallest index of a maximum string in
    lexicographical ordering is returned (hint: use strcmp instead of \texttt{<})

\item Write function \texttt{void print(const int *a, size\_t n);} that prints
    all array elements to cout using a single space as delimiter

\item Write function template print that works like the function in (d) for
    arbitrary element types \texttt{T}

\item In \texttt{main()} write test code that populates a few C-arrays of different type,
    prints them using above print function template, prints the result of the
    \texttt{index\_of\_max} function call, and complains if a test failed.
    \textbf{Hint}: When testing \texttt{const char*} versus \texttt{char*},
    recall that string literals are have the type \texttt{const char *}.
    How can we explicitly declare string literals to be of type \texttt{char*}?
    We shouldn't do this in practice ... WHY?
\end{enumerate}

2. [20 marks] Function templates

\bigskip 

In file \texttt{point.cpp}:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item Write struct template \texttt{Point} that stores two coordinates \texttt{x,y} of arbitrary
type \texttt{T} and has a constructor that takes two parameters \texttt{(x0,y0)} with which
\texttt{x,y} are initialized, respectively. Their default values must be \texttt{T\{\}}
(representing origin coordinate (0)).

\medskip

A print member function also needs to be implemented that writes \texttt{(x,y)} to
cout.
\[ \texttt{void print() const ...} \]

\medskip

Finally, struct member \texttt{operator==} needs to be implemented that returns true
iff the rhs point's coordinates are equal to \texttt{x,y}, respectively.

\item Write function template sum that accepts a const C-array of \texttt{Point} elements,
    array size \texttt{int n} and returns a \texttt{Point} of the same type representing the sum
    of all input \texttt{Points} (component-wise)
\item Write function template find that, like in (b), accepts a const C-array of
    \texttt{Points} and \texttt{size n}, but also a \texttt{Point p} of the same type and returns the
    smallest index for which \texttt{p} is equal to an array element, or -1 otherwise
\item Write test code for (b) and (c) in \texttt{main()}
\end{enumerate}
