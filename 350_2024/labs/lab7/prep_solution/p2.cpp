/*
  runtime:

  inserting into a set runs in O(log m) time when m elements are stored.

  This means that the first loop runs in time O(n log n), because each
  insertion runs in time O(log n).

  Traversing through s takes linear time in n.

  Total time: O(n log n)

  A more strict analysis results in worst case runtime Î˜(n log n).
