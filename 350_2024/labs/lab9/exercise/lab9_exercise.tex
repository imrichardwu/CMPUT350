In this exercise you will complete a program that solves tic-tac-toe states
using \textbf{negamax search} (see AI part4 page 27). I.e., your program will answer
who wins in a given game situation assuming perfect play on both sides.\\

In file \texttt{ttt2.cpp}, which is provided, implement the parts marked with
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
    // ... implement
\end{verbatim}
}
and test your program for correctness and proper cleanup.\\

Use \texttt{./make2} to compile your program. \\

\textbf{IMPORTANT}:
Ensure that your code works for N-by-N tic-tac-toe, i.e., changing value N to
other values than 3 should work, e.g.
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
    static constexpr int N = 4;
\end{verbatim}
}

The winning condition for N-by-N ttt is having N pieces of the same colour in
any row, column, or main diagonal. Given that N can vary, you'll need loops to
detect winning conditions.
